# Advisor

![](../../)

## 简介

Advisor is the hyper parameters tuning system for black box optimization.

It is the open-source implementation of [Google Vizier](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/46180.pdf) with these features.

* Easy to use with API, SDK, WEB and CLI
* Support abstractions of Study and Trial
* Included search and early stop algorithms
* Recommend parameters with trained model
* Same programming interfaces as Google Vizier
* Command-line tool just like Microsoft NNI.
